# MESSAGE-Basin
MESSAGE-Basin is an integrated tool for water-energy-land nexus analysis. The tool combines an infrastructure plannning model with a hydrological model to provide improved insight into the cost and characteristics of development pathways that achieve sustainability targets (figure below). A geospatial database houses various input datasets that are shared between the models. Up- and down-scaling tools are used to soft-link and synchronize the infrastructure (MESSAGEix) and hydrological modeling (CWaTM). The individual models are desribed in greater detail below.

The MESSAGEix and CWaTM models are run sequentially to find pathways that achieve human development targets while maintaining water resource sustainability. Naturalized water availability is initially simulated and passed (upscaled) to the infrastructure planning tool to constrain water use. The infrastructure planning tool finds a portfolio of technologies that can meet future water and energy demands while also achieving various policy targets. Water use simulated with the infrastructure model is then downscaled and run through the hydrological modeling tool to understand how management impacts water sustainability at a high spatial resolution. The tool can thus be used to quantify policy implementation costs covering multiple sectors and development targets. The embedded tools along with the specific geographic and technological representation for the Indus region is described below.

# MESSAGEix
The [MESSAGEix](https://messageix.iiasa.ac.at/) modeling framework combines an engineering-economic model witha data warehouse for high-powered numerical scenario analysis (i.e., ix modeling platform) [@Huppmann2018]. MESSAGE (Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental impact) was originally designed as a linear programming (LP) energy engineering model, but is readily extended to any type of technological supply-chain (i.e., infrastructure system). MESSAGE is a modeling framework for medium- to long-term infrastructure planning, policy analysis, and scenario development. Scenario analysis with MESSAGE is used in two major areas: 1) description of future uncertainties, and 2) the development of robust technology strategies and related investment portfolios to meet a range of user-specified policy objectives. The extension of MESSAGE to include water infrastructure systems is based on previous work that developed fundamental concepts for synchronizing water and energy planning over multiple spatial and temporal scales [@Parkinson2016a, @Khan2018].

# CWatM
The Community Water Model [(CWatM)](https://cwatm.github.io/) provides a grid-based representation of terrestrial hydrology with a spatial resolution of 5 arc-minutes (grid-cells approximately 8 km wide near the equator) on a daily basis [@Burek2018]. Similar to other large-scale hydrological models, CWaTM uses process-based equations to compute moisture storage in vertically stacked soil layers as well as the water exchange between the soil and the atmosphere and a groundwater reservoir. Run-off and groundwater recharge information from CWaTM computed at 5 arc-minutes are upscaled to the region-scale defined in MESSAGEix providing a consistent representation of water resource availability. CWaTM forcing data includes future climate conditions simulated and downscaled from global climate model. This provides foundation for deriving least-cost climate change adaptation strategies for infrastructure systems modeled in MESSSAGEix. Moreover, CWaTM computes irrigation water demands based on static land-use maps that define the current cropping situation in the region. These demands are used in MESSAGEix to estimate the required irrigation infrastructure. Future work will incorporate cropping decisions into MESSAGEix to allow dynamic representation of land-use (e.g., see @Burger2018).
