# Integrated assessment for transforming water-energy-land systems

The NExus Solutions Tool (NEST) is an open-access scientific computing framework designed to aid decision-makers with complex choices regarding the development of water, energy and land systems in a given river basin or administrative region. NEST links an engineering-economic model ([MESSAGE](https://messageix.iiasa.ac.at/)) representing investment and allocation decisions across water, energy and land-use sectors to a distributed hydrological model ([CWatM](https://cwatm.github.io/)) representing the detailed land surface processes at high spatial and temporal resolutions. NEST provides insights into: 

1. the vulnerability of water, energy and land systems to future socioeconomic and climatic change; and 

2. how policies, technological solutions and investments can improve the resiliency and sustainability of transformation pathways while avoiding counterproductive interactions among sectors.


<!-- This website presents the MESSAGE-Indus integrated assessment model, a new tool for water-energy-land nexus analysis. MESSAGE-Indus is being developed within the Integrated Solutions for Water, Energy and Land [(IS-WEL)](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchProjects/Nexus_Solutions.html) project led by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). The framework provides a consistent platform for modeling long-term pathways for water, energy and land systems. The approach is innovative because it hard-links management of interdependent systems across the entire basin and for multiple future time periods. Scenarios explored with the tool are derived through interactive stakeholder engagement incorporating views and objectives from people living and working throughout the basin. This perspective provides unique capabilities to develop pathways relevant in the local contexts that communicate important information regarding the cost and characteristics of infrastructure systems supporting sustainable human development. -->

<!-- # The Indus Basin -->
<!-- The Indus river basin located in South Asia is a transboundary river basin covering area in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and China. The region is a cradle for human civilization, and the rivers running through the basin are critical for human survival and regional economic prosperity. For example, more than 90% of the food consumed in Pakistan is grown in the Indus basin [@Qureshi2011]. In fact, the basin hosts the largest irrigation and canal network in the world [@Yu2013]. Moreover the extreme elevation changes as water flows from the Himalayas in Tibet to the Indus delta in the Arabian Sea provide excellent opportunities to generate low-carbon hydropower generation [@Siddiqi2012].  -->

<!-- Despite significant natural resources, the Indus basin has emerged as one of the most water-stressed regions in the world [@Hoekstra2012]. Almost all of the surface water within the basin has been allocated to specfic uses, and for parts of year the lower Indus rivers run dry with no flow reaching the sea [@Laghari2012].  The history of the region also provides a complicated political backdrop that water management must fit into. Yet, the region has been able to thus far manage potential conflicts through implementation of the hugely successful Indus River Water Treaty, a transboundary water management policy that promotes equitable access to water resources across the India-Pakistan divide [@WB1960, @Wescoat2000, @Wolf2008]. The future nonetheless remains uncertain due to a rapidly expanding population (particularly in urban areas) and impacts of climate change. Integrated solutions are urgently needed to ensure the region avoids crisis and transforms towards a system that supports long-term human development while maintaining environmental integrity.       -->

<!-- # Nexus Challenges -->
<!-- There are immense development challenges in the Indus stemming from the water-energy-land nexus. Specific nexus challenges are highlighted below.  -->

<!-- - 95% of surface water is used for irrigation but due to losses only 35% actually reaches the field [@Laghari2012, @Yu2013]. Thus there exists significant opportunities to improve up- and down-stream water allocation and reduce water stress by improving agricultural management.  -->

<!-- - A lack of available surface water has resulted in acceleratated development of groundwater systems in the Indus [@Cheema2014]. The Punjab provinces in both Pakistan and India are now witnessing rapid depletion of groundwater. In other regions, groundwater pumping is needed to manage salinity [@Qureshi2008]. The energy required for pumping groundwater is also a source of greenhouse gas emissions when fossil energy resources are used [@Siddiqi2013]. -->

<!-- - Water storage capacity is very low throughout the basin, and expanding storage capacity has the potential to impact land availability. Moreover, existing storage capacity is used mainly to support downstream irrigation. This can present conflicts with hydropower generation when electricity demands are not aligned with irrigation uses [@Yang2016].  -->

<!-- - The riparian countries are facing an important energy deficit that could be met partly with expanded hydropower generation [@Siddiqi2012]. Alternatively, certain regions are planning to expand coal power generation in response to energy deficits, which could place further strain on regional water resources due to the water required for resource extraction and power plant operations. -->

<!-- - Surface water quality is severely degraded in many locations downstream from urban and industrial areas due to abscence of wastewater treatment [@CSIRO2018]. Energy will be needed to support wastewater treatment, and increasingly to support wastewater recycling (advanced treatment and/or pumping to alternative uses). -->

<!-- - Agricultural practices often involve burning of crop residues left on fields [@Cusworth2018]. The combustion is a major source of air pollution throughout the region.  -->

<!-- # Previous Work -->
<!-- The Indus basin has been the subject of many previous studies. Notably, previous studies focus on identifying impacts of human activities and climate variability and change on the Indus system, e.g., [@Fowler2006, @Immerzeel2010, @Cheema2014, @Lutz2016, @Mukhopadhyay2015, @Wescoat2018]. These studies provide invaluable foundation for understanding Indus basin challenges. Yet, there remains a fundamental knowledge gap in terms of integrated solutions, i.e., how to address multiple interdependent challenges during system transformation from the perspective of the entire basin. For example, recent work led by the World Bank provides a comprehensive analysis of future conditions in the basin including an assessment of adaptation options [@Yu2013, @Yang2014, @Yang2016], but focused mainly on adaptive solutions from the water perspective in Pakistan, thus missing broader transformations of energy and land systems across the basin. New quantitative integrated assessment tools are needed to identify policies enabling sustainable management of the region's stressed water resources.  -->

<!-- # Research Objectives -->
<!-- The objective of the research is to develop a new nexus tool to identify sustainable development pathways at the river basin-scale i.e., MESSAGE-Indus. The framework aims at filling the knowledge gap identified above by incorporating the following features:  -->

<!-- - Balances human development and environmental objectives -->

<!-- - Integrates water and energy infrastructure planning with land-use management across the entire basin -->

<!-- - Incorporates key global change processes in the assessment of resource availability -->

<!-- - Incorporates key regional and local indicators from stakeholders -->

<!-- - Flexible approach for application in other basins -->
