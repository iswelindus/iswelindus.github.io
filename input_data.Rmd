# Basin Delineation
A river basin is defined by a geographic area where all incident precipitation converted to runoff is directed towards a single outlet to the sea (or inland lake). In this work, the Indus river basin is delineated based on this hydrological definition using the [HydroBASINS](http://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydrobasins) global dataset. HydroBASINS is a series of polygon layers that depict basin and sub-basin delineations at a global scale. Using hydrologically corrected digital elevation data from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission at 15 arc-second resolution, watersheds (or sub-basins) are delineated in a consistent manner in HydroBASINS at different scales, and a hierarchical sub-basin breakdown is created following the topological concept of the Pfafstetter coding system [@Lehner2013].
